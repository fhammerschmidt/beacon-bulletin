## Introduction

This application, consisting of an Android-App based on react-native as frontend and a lightweight RESTful backend provides a "bulletin" user-interface which connects with bluetooth low energy beacons to determine the users location.

## Explanation

Given a modern university campus, where students can book learning or project rooms over a web-interface with just their user credentials, one application of a personalized bulletin is a "book now" button when standing nearby the corresponding room. Furthermore, different data about the room (No. of seats, upcoming lectures) can be displayed. This app is a work in progress and tries to find other possible applications of beacons on university campuses.
